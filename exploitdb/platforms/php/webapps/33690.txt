DosyaYukle Scripti is prone to a remote file-upload vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Attackers can exploit this issue to upload arbitrary code and run it in the context of the webserver process. This may facilitate unauthorized access or privilege escalation; other attacks are also possible.

DosyaYukle Scripti 1.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
