auraCMS is affected by multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

These issues exist because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Because of these vulnerabilities, an attacker may craft a link containing malicious HTML or script code and present the link to a victim. If the victim user follows the link, the attacker-supplied code will be executed in their browser in the security context of the vulnerable site.
