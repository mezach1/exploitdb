It is reported that CubeCart is susceptible to an SQL injection vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied URI data prior to including it in an SQL query.

An attacker may exploit this issue to manipulate SQL queries, potentially revealing or corrupting sensitive database data. This issue may also facilitate attacks against the underlying database software.

This vulnerability is reported to exist in version 2.0.1 of CubeCart. Other versions may also be affected.
