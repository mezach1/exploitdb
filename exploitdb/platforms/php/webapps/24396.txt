Reportedly the JShop E-Commerce Suite is affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the 'page.php' script. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly santitize user-supplied input.

As a result of this vulnerability, it is possible for a remote attacker to create a malicious link containing script code that will be executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user when followed. This may facilitate the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials as well as other attacks.
