JShop E-Commerce Suite is affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the 'product.php' script.

As a result of this vulnerability, it is possible for a remote attacker to create a malicious link containing script code that will be executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user when followed. This may facilitate the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials as well as other attacks.
