It has been reported that Siteframe does not sufficiently filter user supplied URI parameters on Siteframe pages. 

As a result of this deficiency, it is possible for a remote attacker to create a malicious link containing script code that will be executed in the browser of a legitimate user. All code will be executed within the context of the website running Siteframe. 

This may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials and other attacks.

This vulnerability was reported to affect Siteframe version 2.2.4, it is not currently known if other versions are affected.
