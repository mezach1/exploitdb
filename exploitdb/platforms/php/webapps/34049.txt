Layout CMS is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability and a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Layout CMS 1.0 is vulnerable; other versions may be affected.
