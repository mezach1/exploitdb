PHP Live! is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. 
  
An attacker may leverage these issues to have arbitrary script code execute in the browser of an unsuspecting user. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.
  
Version 3.2.2 was reported vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
