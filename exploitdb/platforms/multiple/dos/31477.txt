The 'snircd' and 'ircd' daemons are prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successfully exploiting this issue allows remote attackers to crash the application, denying service to legitimate users.

This issue affects versions up to and including 'snircd' 1.3.4 and 'ircu' 2.10.12.12.
