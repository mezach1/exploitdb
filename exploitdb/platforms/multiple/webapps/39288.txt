ManageEngine Password Manager Pro and ManageEngine IT360 are prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query.

Exploiting this issue could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

The following products are affected:

ManageEngine Password Manager Pro 5 through 7 build 7003
ManageEngine IT360 8 through 10.1.1 build 10110
