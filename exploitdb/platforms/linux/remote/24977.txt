CUPS is reported prone to a remote buffer overflow vulnerability. The issue is reported to exist in the 'hpgl-input.c' source file and is because of a lack of sufficient boundary checks performed on data contained in HPGL files.

A remote attacker may exploit this condition to execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable CUPS daemon.
