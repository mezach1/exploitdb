R2/Extreme is prone to a stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability and a directory-traversal vulnerability.

Exploiting these issues may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or retrieve arbitrary files within the context of the affected application.

R2/Extreme 1.65 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
