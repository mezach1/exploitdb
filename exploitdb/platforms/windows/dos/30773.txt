Microsoft Jet Database Engine is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied data.

Remote attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary machine code in the context of a user running the application. Successful exploits will compromise the affected application and possibly the underlying computer. Failed attacks will likely cause denial-of-service conditions.

NOTE: Further details report that attackers are using malicious Word files to load specially crafted MDB files. Microsoft has released a knowledge base article (950627) documenting this attack vector.

This issue does not affect Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2, Windows XP Service Pack 3, Windows XP x64 edition Server Pack 2, Windows Vista, Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008 because they run a version of the Jet Database Engine that isn't vulnerable.

This issue does affect the Jet Database Engine, Microsoft Word 2000 Service Pack 3, Microsoft Word 2002 Service Pack 3, Microsoft Word 2003 Service Pack 2, Microsoft Word 2003 Service Pack 3, Microsoft Word 2007, and Microsoft Word 2007 Service Pack 1 on Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1.
