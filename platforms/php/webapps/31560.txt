CuteFlow Bin is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data. The issues include a SQL-injection vulnerability and multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
    
Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.
    
These issues affect CuteFlow Bin 1.5.0; other versions may also be affected.
