Aterr is prone to local file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities using directory-traversal strings to view files and execute local scripts in the context of the webserver process. This may aid in further attacks.

The issues affect Aterr 0.9.1; other versions might also be affected.
