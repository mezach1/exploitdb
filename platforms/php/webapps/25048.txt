PsychoStats is reported prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied URI input.

The problem presents itself when malicious HTML and script code is sent to the application through the 'login' parameter.

This vulnerability may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks.

This vulnerability is reported to exist in PsychoStats 2.2.4 Beta and prior versions.
