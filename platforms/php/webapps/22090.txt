A vulnerability has been discovered in the PHP-Nuke web mail module. Due to insufficient sanitization of HTML emails it is possible for an attacker to embed script code into malicious messages. Opening an email containing attacker-supplied script code would result in the execution of arbitrary script code within the client's browser.
