PowerScripts PowerNews is prone to multiple local file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to access potentially sensitive information and execute arbitrary local scripts in the context of the affected application.

PowerNews 2.5.6 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
