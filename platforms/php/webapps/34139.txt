Yamamah Photo Gallery is prone to a local file-disclosure vulnerability because it fails to adequately validate user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain potentially sensitive information from local files on computers running the vulnerable application. This may aid in further attacks.

Yamamah 1.00 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
