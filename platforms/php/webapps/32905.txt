LinPHA is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

Attackers can leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help attackers steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Versions prior to LinPHA 1.3.4 are vulnerable.
