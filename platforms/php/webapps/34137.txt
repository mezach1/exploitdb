The VideoWhisper 2 Way Video Chat component for Joomla! is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.
