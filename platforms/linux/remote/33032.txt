The 'Compress::Raw::Zlib' Perl module is prone to a remote code-execution vulnerability.

Successful exploits may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause denial-of-service conditions in applications that use the vulnerable module.

Versions prior to 'Compress::Raw::Zlib' 2.017 are affected.
